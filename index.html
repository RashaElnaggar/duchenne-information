              Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disorder characterised by progressive symmetric muscle weakness (proximal>distal)
            commencing in the thighs and pelvis, then extending to other muscles of the body.
            DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in children.The incidence rate of DMD is 10.7 to 27.8 per 100,000 newborn males. 
            In the UK, about 100 boys are born with DMD each year, 
            and there are about 2,500 people living with the condition at any one time.
            DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by genetic variants in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome.
            This means that it usually affects boys, though girls can be affected in rare cases.

               DMD should be considered in all boys who have delayed motor milestones and speech delay, 
            especially when they occur in addition to a positive family history compatible with X-linked inheritance.
            Most individuals with DMD can today expect to survive until at least their early 20s, some even longer, 
            and many maintain a good quality of life.
            Complications of DMD include respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, osteoporosis and learning disability.
            Symptoms are not usually evident until 18 months of age, and many boys are not diagnosed until five years of age.
            Increasing awareness of the condition should improve early diagnosis
